i often choose distraction as the best form of ignorance<br>
the world is often terrifying <br>
<br>
i’m tired - lying at the edge of my bed, heart unable to decide <br>
its fate; between the depths of the covers or up past the rain-clouds <br>
that obscure a vision of the flames of heaven <br>
<br>
calm is abstract - a concept that i have failed to grasp<br>
always busy; a city rat with little purpose but gnawing through<br>
an ever-growing stack of sheets; the end always just out of reach<br>
<br>
are those who appreciate me here to stay?<br>
so far, they’ve all disappeared <br>
for a valiant few, i’m unsure of secret resentment or true approval<br>
<br>
yet they are never what i’m looking for <br>
the present is never satisfying <br>
<br>
“now” is an unsatisfying image of the past; <br>
what was once despised, now faded<br>
leaving you wondering, how you lacked joy<br>
<br>
 the future being a foggy prospect<br>
the hope for greatness, demeaning the now<br>
occludes today’s reality with a dream of eventual satisfaction<br>
<br>
knowing it’s not true. <br>
inevitable discontent.<br>
inescapable distress. <br>
<br>
music offers a calming escape from the tumultuous present,<br>
yet i never find the time to make my own<br>
i tell myself it will happen soon.<br>
<br>
yet, i always do. <br><br>
