<br>
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,<br>
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,<br>
To the last syllable of recorded time,<br>
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools<br>
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!<br>
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,<br>
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,<br>
And then is heard no more. It is a tale<br>
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,<br>
Signifying nothing.<br>
