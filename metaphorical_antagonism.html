    1. Death rhetoric in academia serves as a form of institutional and mechanical power projection to secure some future. That causes anxiety over the passage of time which starves presentism. 
    <br><blockquote>a.	What is power projection? It is the method by which subjects in academic settings utilize tales of a country or nation’s own capacity and capability to project power in some conflict or issue. The critique characterizes death and extinction impacts as falsehoods brought about in academic settings to enact western governance onto unconforming subjects. This process is metaphorical antagonism---extinction itself as a metaphor that ignores the real pain and suffering it enacts---and antagonism which represents the unconfirming subject’s repressed desire for freedom from the system. 
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>b.	The critique characterizes power projection by the methods and justifications that exist in debate for institutional and mechanical physical governance and securitization. These represent the methods by which the state enacts this power. The state uses stories, such as those told in debate about its own power, in order to secure a continued western future. 
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>c.	This causes anxiety over the passage of time. Because subjects lack a sense of inner freedom, they find it difficult to locate and cherish their present. Recurring focus on solving the issues of the future leads to subjects ignoring the present, which over time destroys their ability to do that in the first place absent extreme anxiety over the passage of time. Extinction, characterized as a finitude, an absolute that will undoubtedly come upon us, creates a rhetoric that incentivizes fear about the “inevitable end of the world!” regarding nearly any situation---from climate change to nuclear war to food shortage. Jurisprudence often defers the present for concerns of the future---trading the disregard of current suffering and death in favor of saving alleged future lives. 
    </blockquote>
    2. Jurisprudence involves a reckoning with hyper-textual material. That takes place in the field of pain and death which reifies government as a socio-technical machine dedicated to the eradication of life, as modern violence’s death discourse is always present in the judicial act. 
        <br><blockquote>a. Hyper-textualization is the method by which modern jurisprudence attempts to sanitize and judge law. This relates to all forms of “law” in academic spaces, from judges in debates to courts. Law, ultimately, is storytelling that connects the present to strive towards some future, but modern legality uses the material practices of writing, managing, and organizing texts. The common law---however---as Camus describes it, is unwritten and unwritable. Law, or the plan, should not exist as a piece of textual legislation. This embeds policymaking in a field that inevitably ignores death, reducing sovereign violence into dilemmas of interpretive fidelity between the text of law and the actions of human decision-makers. 
        </blockquote><blockquote>b.	The critique makes the argument that this process of lawmaking leaves policymakers in a field of pain and death, formed by the cybernetic interactions that exist between human and textual material. Jurisprudence’s focus on textual material attempts to form meaning to text, which ignores the inherent basis of law in manufacturing specific futures. Law, policymaking, and judges are trained to form a time-death machine, which focuses on securing the future, ignoring death in the present. 
        </blockquote><blockquote>c.	This process of lawmaking becomes increasingly irrelevant in the present, as the digitalization of our lives has forced paper texts to irrelevancy to much of the population.  
        </blockquote>
    3. Thus, I advocate for institutional absurdity that challenges the speculative system. The status quo’s deference of absurdism distances subjects between the self and world. This method challenges this rhetoric to rupture echo-chambers of being.
    <br><blockquote>a. Thus, we advocate for absurdity. Simply put, absurdity represents a focus on the present, to live in the moment rather than within a modern-echo chamber of unending speculative imagination and simulation. 
    </blockquote><blockquote>b.	What does it mean to be within an echo-chamber of simulation? The critique characterizes the non-absurd world as trapping subjects in constant anxiety for the future, which repeatedly imagines extinction and other death-based conflict. This leads to subjects ignoring the tragedies of today, instead indefinitely worrying about their own, mythical, eventual demise. 
    </blockquote><blockquote>c.	Sisyphus cannot hope, for to hope is to surrender to anticipation of the future. The process of hope is contrary to absurdism, which aims to rebuke, in the present day, modern jurisprudence’s focus on solving mythic future tragedies, in order to support attempts to end current death.
